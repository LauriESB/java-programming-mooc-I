## this is one of the two repositories made to track my progress on University of Helsinkiâ€™s MOOC on Java Programming.

<br>
 
> [!IMPORTANT]
> the exercises are tested using their automatic testing service Test My Code + NetBeans. the course has been divided in two individual parts ([see part II here](https://github.com/LauriESB/java-programming-mooc-II)):

```
Java Programming I (Part 1 to 7)

Java Programming II (Part 8 to 14) 
```
